## Introduction
   We know how it's sometimes realy complicated for a developper in Cameroon to get hire by a companie for a full time job, or just get Hire for a single project, i created this project to resolve that problem (For Python developper....), it's a really simple app, fetching and notify suscribers, PyToMe fetch jobs around multiple websites(Only PYTHON's one) and notify every developper that subscribe to it.

## How it's works
PyToMe have a list of website where it wil fetch data(jobs/projects) and will notify developper with a frequency that will be configure.

## How to use it
- First Suscribe to [PyToMe](https://github.com/pytome)
- Enjoy ;-)

## TODO
- [-] The Python Job(Collecting jobs all over website every day.)
- [-] The Python Mailing system to notify all developpers subscribed on this app
- [-] The Web pae presentation of PyToMe
- [-] The Python Config (For personnalize notifications)
    - [-] The Type (Remote Jobs, full time, etc...).
    - [-] The country / city.
    - [-] The number of notifications.
    - [-] The delay from notifications.
