   We know how it's sometimes realy complicated for a developper in Cameroon to get hire by a companie for a full time job, or just get Hire for a single project, i created this project to resolve that problem (For Python developpers....), it's a really simple app, fetching and notify suscribers, PyToMe fetch jobs around multiple websites(Only PYTHON's one) and notify every developper that subscribe to it.

## How it's works
PyToMe have a list of website where it wil fetch data(jobs/projects) and will notify developper with a frequency that will be configure.
